### Co-op Work Experience

**Software Development Co-op**
*The Helix Innovation Center/Emerson Climate Technologies - September 2022*
- Collaborated with a team of 3 to implement a new approach to critical code, enabling the implementation of 
patented algorithms central to the function of the Indoor Air Quality system.
- Developed custom SmartThings Edge device drivers using the Lua programming language, enabling 
communication between a central hub and air quality sensors in a local API with edge technology protocol.
- Created machine learning models to predict and analyze defrost cycles in various cooler cases, utilizing 
metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared values to measure the performance of the models.

#### Project Sought
- I'm interested in pursuing a capstone project focused on conceptualizing a product, application, or service 
related to AI. For instance, creating an AI solution that is smarter and more versatile than Siri, similar 
to enhancing its capabilities.
